## Project Abstract

Canadian livestock transporters are required to follow rules and regulations specified by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) before, during, and after animal transport. The current process requires paper manifests to be created and maintained by transporters to ensure that all animals and their data are collected for business, market, and tracing purposes; it is not well suited to transporters who may not have access to materials while on the road. Humane Transport is a mobile application which provides transporters with a paper-free way to collect and provide all CFIA required data while meeting the requirements of the Health of Animals Regulations Part XII, Humane transport of animals (sections 136-155), and providing access to interpretive guidance documentation to assist understanding.
